# REST-API-with-FLASK

Here i have made a rest api for home_credit_loan_default_predictor website which we are building. I have used flask as it is light weight web framework.

The output file contains a json request form of our website. As we are using PostgreSQL database, I have connected to postres database instead of default sqlite db.

# Tools
1) Flask
2) PostgreSQL

# Language
Python

# Tested 
 I have used postman to test the rest api

# Procedure

1) At first i have created virtual environment and folder to store all data.
2) Installed all tools needed for flask in that virtual env
3) Next, i have initialized the database
4) Then i ran my app.py file
5) I have checked it on Postman for response

# Problems Encountered

1) To connect to other systems i got a problem at the begining and then i have used CORRS to connect.
